description: Create runbooks, playbooks, and technical documentation for engineering teams, with Notion integration for storing SOPs directly in your Second Brain. Use when the user wants to document a process, create a runbook, build operational docs, or formalize any repeatable technical procedure. Triggers on requests like "create a runbook for...", "document this process", "write a playbook", or any technical documentation request.

# SOP & Runbook Creator

Create practical documentation that people actually follow.

## Philosophy

**Nobody reads 50-page docs.** Make it scannable, actionable, and impossible to misunderstand.

Core principles:
- **Scannable** - Headers, bullets, tables. No walls of text.
- **Actionable** - Every step is something you DO, not something you "consider"
- **Specific** - Numbers, names, thresholds. No "as needed" or "when appropriate"
- **Testable** - Clear success criteria. How do you know it worked?
- **Maintained** - Owner, last updated, review schedule

## SOP Categories

Pick the right format for your use case:

### Tech/Engineering
| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Runbook** | Emergency response, incidents, on-call |
| **Deployment Playbook** | Releases, migrations, maintenance |
| **Troubleshooting Guide** | Debugging, diagnosis trees |
| **How-To Guide** | One-off setup, configuration |
| **ADR** | Architecture decisions |

### Operations/Business
| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Process SOP** | Repeatable business workflows |
| **Checklist** | Quality control, verification |
| **Decision Tree** | Complex if/then scenarios |
| **Handoff Doc** | Role transitions, shift changes |

### Content/Creative
| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Production Workflow** | Content creation pipelines |
| **Review Process** | Approval workflows |
| **Publishing Checklist** | Pre-launch verification |

### General
| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Standard SOP** | Any repeatable process |
| **Quick Reference** | Condensed version of longer SOP |
| **Onboarding Guide** | New person ramping up |

## Universal Structure

Every SOP needs at minimum:

```markdown
# [What This Does]

> **TL;DR:** One sentence - what, when, who.

## Definition of Done

This is complete when:
- [ ] [Primary outcome]
- [ ] [Verification step]
- [ ] [Any handoff/notification]

## When to Use This
[Trigger conditions]

## Prerequisites
[What you need before starting]

## The Process
[Numbered steps - the actual work]

## Verify Completion
[Return to Definition of Done, confirm all checked]

## When Things Go Wrong
[Common issues and fixes]

## Questions?
[Who to contact]
```

**Definition of Done is the most important section.** Put it near the top. Make it a checklist. Be specific.

## Writing Rules

### Be Specific

| Don't Write | Write Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Contact the team" | "Message @sarah in #ops-team" |
| "Wait until ready" | "Wait until status shows 'Complete' (~5 min)" |
| "Review carefully" | "Check items A, B, C in the dashboard" |
| "As appropriate" | "If value > 100" |
| "Regularly" | "Every Monday at 9am" |
| "Soon" | "Within 2 hours" |

### Action-First Steps

```markdown
# Bad
"The report should be reviewed before sending to ensure
accuracy and completeness of all data fields."

# Good
1. Open the report in [System]
2. Verify these fields are populated:
   - [ ] Customer name
   - [ ] Amount
   - [ ] Date
3. Click "Send"
```

### Warnings Come First

```markdown
# Bad
1. Delete the old records
   Note: This cannot be undone

# Good
> **WARNING:** This permanently deletes records. Export first if needed.

1. Delete the old records
```

### Decision Points are Clear

```markdown
# Bad
"Handle the request based on priority level"

# Good
**If priority is:**
- **Critical:** Drop everything, handle now, notify manager
- **High:** Handle within 4 hours
- **Normal:** Handle within 24 hours
- **Low:** Add to weekly batch
```

## Format Selection Guide

Ask yourself:

1. **Is this for emergencies?** → Runbook
2. **Is this a complex multi-phase project?** → Playbook
3. **Is this a simple repeated task?** → Standard SOP or Checklist
4. **Does it have lots of if/then branching?** → Decision Tree
5. **Is it for debugging?** → Troubleshooting Guide
6. **Is it recording a decision?** → ADR
7. **Is it for someone new?** → Onboarding Guide

## Metadata (Keep it Light)

```yaml
---
title: [Clear name]
owner: [Person or team]
last_updated: [Date]
review_schedule: [quarterly/annually/as-needed]
---
```

That's it. No document IDs, version matrices, or approval chains unless you actually need them.

## Notion Output

After generating the SOP content, save it to the user's Notion workspace:

### 1. Find the SOPs Database

Use the `notion-search` MCP tool to search for the "SOPs" database in Notion:
```
Search for: "SOPs"
Filter: database
```

### 2. Create the Page

Use `notion-create-pages` to create a new page in the SOPs database with these properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Title** | The SOP title (e.g., "Incident Response Runbook") |
| **Category** | One of: `Tech`, `Ops`, `Content`, `General` — pick based on SOP type from the categories above |
| **Owner** | As specified by the user. If not provided, ask who should own this SOP. |
| **Status** | `Draft` (always for new SOPs) |
| **Review Schedule** | `Quarterly` for critical/on-call runbooks, `Annually` for standard SOPs, `As-needed` for one-off how-to guides |

### 3. Format the Page Body

Convert the SOP content to Notion-flavored markdown for the page body. Key formatting notes:
- Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) for structure
- Use checklists (`- [ ]`) for Definition of Done and prerequisites
- Use tables for reference data and troubleshooting
- Use code blocks for commands and examples
- Use callouts/quotes (`>`) for warnings and TL;DR sections

### 4. Category Selection Guide

| SOP Type | Category |
|----------|----------|
| Runbook, Deployment Playbook, Troubleshooting Guide, How-To Guide, ADR | `Tech` |
| Process SOP, Checklist, Decision Tree, Handoff Doc | `Ops` |
| Production Workflow, Review Process, Publishing Checklist | `Content` |
| Standard SOP, Quick Reference, Onboarding Guide | `General` |

### 5. Local Backup Option

After saving to Notion, offer to also save the SOP as a local `.md` file if the user prefers a local backup. Suggest a path like `docs/sops/[sop-name].md` or let the user specify.

## Templates

Each template is in `references/`:

| Template | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| [runbook.md](references/runbook.md) | Incidents, emergencies, on-call |
| [standard-sop.md](references/standard-sop.md) | Any repeatable process |
| [how-to-guide.md](references/how-to-guide.md) | One-off tasks, setup |
| [onboarding-guide.md](references/onboarding-guide.md) | New person ramping up |
| [decision-tree.md](references/decision-tree.md) | Complex if/then flows |
| [checklist.md](references/checklist.md) | QC, verification |

**All templates have Definition of Done as the primary success criteria.**

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing:
- [ ] Can someone unfamiliar follow this?
- [ ] Are all steps actionable (verbs, not descriptions)?
- [ ] Are specifics provided (names, numbers, thresholds)?
- [ ] Is there a clear "done" state?
- [ ] Is the owner/contact info current?
- [ ] Has it been tested recently?

## Anti-Patterns

**Kill these:**
- "Per company policy..." (just state what to do)
- "It is recommended that..." (just say "do X")
- "Please ensure..." (just say "check X")
- Passive voice ("the form should be submitted" → "submit the form")
- Describing what to do instead of showing it
- Walls of text with no structure
- Screenshots that will be outdated in a month

**Do these:**
- Start with the most common path
- Put edge cases at the bottom
- Link to related docs instead of duplicating
- Use tables for reference info
- Use checklists for verification steps
- Include "I'm stuck" escape hatches
